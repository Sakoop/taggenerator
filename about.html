        <p>The tags included were compiled from ao3's <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/admin_posts/18804" class="formatted-link" style="text-decoration:underline;"  target="_blank">official tag rankings</a> from 2021; I only included around 1000.</p>
        <p>One thousand out of tens of thousands. If you think one of your favs isn't in the list, <a href="https://twitter.com/dxvisive" class="formatted-link" style="text-decoration:underline;" target="_blank">dm it to me</a> and I'll add it if it's not.</p>
        <p>My original intent here was for creative purposes, like a prompt generater. You have three random tags, how can you create a story out of them? But a lot of the tags are like, cum-eater! Nothing wrong with that, but do with it what you will.</p>
